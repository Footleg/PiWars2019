# PiWars2019
Code for my robot entry in the [PiWars](https://piwars.org) 2019 robotics competition.

This uses my pygame controller project with the Adafruit 16 channel PWM board to control 4 servos for steering and 2 sets of motors for variable speed driving. Using a Hyperpixel 4 touch screen for a UI, and a host of i2c devices for sensors and display.

A full digital mock up of the robot is on the 'mock' branch. Switch to that branch for instructions on how to deploy and run the digital twin of my robot without needing the robot hardware. You will still need a compatible game controller (see my [pygame-controller](https://github.com/Footleg/pygame-controller) project for details).
